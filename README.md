My Hobby Showcase
Welcome to my personal hobby showcase! My name is Egbie for short and I created this webpage to share my hobbies with the world. As an avid swimmer, learner, and reader, I wanted to create a space where I could display my interests and connect with others who share similar passions.

How the Site Works
The site is designed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Media queries ensure that the site is optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

In addition to the responsive design, I also used JavaScript to create some interactive elements like the time and being able to click on a button to display more. 

Exploring My Hobbies
On the homepage, you will see a grid of images that represent my different hobbies. Each image is clickable and will take you to a side page dedicated to that hobby. For example, if you click on the swimming image, a side page will open showcase why I love swimming
